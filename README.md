This assignment called for us to be able to create, read, update and delete a set of values that were stored in a SQL database and to do this through a webpage that uses express and express handlebars.  

The aspect of this assignment I found most challenging I think is probably a new reality of our assignments as we start to create full stack applications.  A luxury of working on either back end or front end is that testing is much less arduous. As you get through sections of your code, you can immediately check whether they're working by displaying the front end page or through using node at the command line.  Now, the setup for testing is longer and you have to write quite a bit of different bits of code before you can see that what you've created is working.  

Regarding this assignment, I found that using handlebars was definitely useful.  It's nice being able to iterate through front end results directly in code that will generate your final HTML.  This would have been very useful when coding out the results page in our first project.

I had a few issues with displaying the results through handlebars but addressed them quickly.  Otherwise, pretty straightforward assignment.
